    *	What should the team stop doing?
      *	The team should stop dividing the work by User stories as well as overestimating the difficulty of our tasks. 
    *	What should the team continue doing?
      * 	The team should continue to execute great communication, share information and helpful resources to assist during programming. In addition, the team should continue to collaborate and stay positive during difficult periods.
